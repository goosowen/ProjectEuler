1. Categorize TODOs from the code
2. Remove all need for chdir
3. Structure project much better https://dev.to/codemouse92/dead-simple-python-project-structure-and-imports-38c6

5. Improve README
    - Add Motivation
    - Add Instructions
    - Add Attribution to Project Euler and EulerPy

6. Separate requirements.txt for modules in solvers
7. Better logging
8. Display statistics as we go, even in parallel
9. Show the machine time each task took, even in parallel
10. Generate documentation with Pycco https://realpython.com/generating-code-documentation-with-pycco/?__s=zormchdsmgaxbhwnhehj
11. Oooh maybe add capabilities to display problems in a Jupyter notebook?

- Generator
    - Get up-to-date answers as I go
- Displayer
    - Neatly show missed questions
    - Performance graph fun
- Runner
    - Lazy initialization of primes, factors, other shared code, if we want to 'cheat'
    - LogDebug in problem solutions (don't get run with runner.py)
- Performance
    - Pandigital permutation approach
- Maintenance
    - Unit tests for common code
    - Copy in resources as part of generator
    - Common code in common places
    - PEP8
    - requirements.txt
