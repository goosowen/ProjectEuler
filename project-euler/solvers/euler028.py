Project Euler Problem 28
=======================

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise
direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

                              21 22 23 24 25
                              20  7  8  9 10
                              19  6  1  2 11
                              18  5  4  3 12
                              17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of both diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of both diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the
same way?
