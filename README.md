# ProjectEuler
My solutions and performance testing for all Project Euler problems https://projecteuler.net/

## TODOS
- Add Motivation Here
- Add Instructions Here
- Add Attribution to Project Euler and EulerPy Here

- Separate requirements.txt for modules in solvers

- Generator
    - Get up to date answers as I go
    - Finish copying over solvers_old and then delete
- Displayer
    - Neatly show missed questions
    - Performance graph fun
- Runner
    - Lazy initialization of primes, factors, other shared code
    - LogDebug in problem solutions (don't get run with runner.py)
- Performance
    - Pandigital permutation approach
- Maintenance
    - Unit tests for common code
    - Copy in resources as part of generator
    - Common code in common places
    - PEP8
    - requirements.txt
