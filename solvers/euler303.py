Project Euler Problem 303
=======================

For a positive integer n, define f(n) as the least positive multiple of n
that, written in base 10, uses only digits ≤ 2.

Thus f(2)=2, f(3)=12, f(7)=21, f(42)=210, f(89)=1121222.

Also, ∑[f(n)/n] for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 is 11363107.

Find ∑[f(n)/n] for 1 ≤ n ≤ 10000.
