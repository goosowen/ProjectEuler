Project Euler Problem 104
=======================

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

  F[n] = F[n[1]] + F[n[2]], where F[1] = 1 and F[2] = 1.

It turns out that F[541], which contains 113 digits, is the first
Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital
(contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And
F[2749], which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for
which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.

Given that F[k] is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine
digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.
