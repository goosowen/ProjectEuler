Project Euler Problem 254
=======================

Define f(n) as the sum of the factorials of the digits of n. For example,
f(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32.

Define sf(n) as the sum of the digits of f(n). So sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5.

Define g(i) to be the smallest positive integer n such that sf(n) = i.
Though sf(342) is 5, sf(25) is also 5, and it can be verified that g(5) is
25.

Define sg(i) as the sum of the digits of g(i). So sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7.

Further, it can be verified that g(20) is 267 and ∑ sg(i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ 20
is 156.

What is ∑ sg(i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ 150?
