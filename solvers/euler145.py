Project Euler Problem 145
=======================

Some positive integers n have the property that the sum [ n + reverse(n) ]
consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, 36 + 63 = 99 and
409 + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers reversible; so 36, 63, 409,
and 904 are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either n or
reverse(n).

There are 120 reversible numbers below one-thousand.

How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion (10^9)?
