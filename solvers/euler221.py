Project Euler Problem 221
=======================

We shall call a positive integer A an "Alexandrian integer", if there
exist integers p, q, r such that:

A = p · q · r    and   1 = 1 + 1 + 1
                      A   p   q   r

For example, 630 is an Alexandrian integer (p = 5, q = −7, r = −18).In
fact, 630 is the 6th Alexandrian integer, the first 6 Alexandrian
integers being: 6, 42, 120, 156, 420 and 630.

Find the 150000th Alexandrian integer.
