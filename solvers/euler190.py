Project Euler Problem 190
=======================

Let S[m] = (x[1], x[2], ... , x[m]) be the m-tuple of positive real
numbers with x[1] + x[2] + ... + x[m] = m for which P[m] = x[1] * x[2]^2 *
... * x[m]^m is maximised.

For example, it can be verified that [P[10]] = 4112 ([ ] is the integer
part function).

Find S[P[m]] for 2 m 15.
