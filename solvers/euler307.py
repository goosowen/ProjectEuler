Project Euler Problem 307
=======================

k defects are randomly distributed amongst n integrated-circuit chips
produced by a factory (any number of defects may be found on a chip and
each defect is independent of the other defects).

Let p(k, n) represent the probability that there is a chip with at least
3 defects. For instance p(3, 7) â‰ˆ 0.0204081633.

Find p(20 000, 1 000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal
places in the form 0.abcdefghij
