Project Euler Problem 118
=======================

Using all of the digits 1 through 9 and concatenating them freely to form
decimal integers, different sets can be formed. Interestingly with the set
{2,5,47,89,631}, all of the elements belonging to it are prime.

How many distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine
exactly once contain only prime elements?
