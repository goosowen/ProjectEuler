Project Euler Problem 326
=======================

Let a[n] be a sequence recursively defined by:

[Image: 326_formula1.gif]

So the first 10 elements of a[n] are: 1,1,0,3,0,3,5,4,1,9.

Let f(N,M) represent the number of pairs (p,q) such that:

It can be seen that f(10,10)=4 with the pairs (3,3), (5,5), (7,9) and
(9,10). You are also given that f(10^4,10^3)=97158.

Find f(10^12,10^6).
