Project Euler Problem 117
=======================

Using a combination of black square tiles and oblong tiles chosen from:
red tiles measuring two units, green tiles measuring three units, and blue
tiles measuring four units, it is possible to tile a row measuring five
units in length in exactly fifteen different ways.
